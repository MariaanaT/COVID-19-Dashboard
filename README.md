# COVID-19 study

Study on the spreading of COVID-19 based on data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. [The dataset](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) is updated weekly. When the notebook is run the dataset is loaded from the original source, so there is no need to download the dataset to one's computer. The notebooks are updated twice a month or so using the latest data. 

* The main results can be found from notebook [COVID-19 study ECDC](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC.ipynb). 

* There is another notebook [COVID-19 study ECDC-Global Timeseries.ipynb](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Global%20Timeseries.ipynb) visualizing the spread of the COVID-19 globally also with animations. 

* There is also a notebook [COVID-19 study ECDC-Global.ipynb](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Global.ipynb) to illustrate the cases and deaths globally, especially comparing the spread between different continents. 

* Basic study based on data from John Hopkins University can be found from notebook [COVID-19 study JHU.ipynb](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) This notebook is not updated regularly.
